module: migrate
short_description: Migrates a VMware virtual machine to OpenStack.
description:
  - This module orchestrates the migration of a specified VMware virtual machine (C(vmname)) to OpenStack.
  - It requires connection details for both the source vSphere environment (C(server), C(user), C(password))
    and the destination OpenStack cloud (C(dst_cloud)).
  - The module handles disk discovery and data transfer, potentially using VMware VDDK (path specified by C(vddkpath)).
  - It can associate the migrated VM with an existing OpenStack instance UUID (C(instanceuuid)) or manage it as a new entity.
  - Options for CBT sync, SOCKS proxy, compression, and a first boot script are available.
author: "OpenStack tenant migration tools (@os-migrate)"
version_added: "1.0.0"
options:
  dst_cloud:
    description:
      - A dictionary containing authentication and connection parameters for the destination OpenStack cloud.
      - This should include details like C(auth_url), C(username), C(password), C(project_name), C(user_domain_name),
        C(project_domain_name), C(region_name), etc., or a C(cloud) key to use a clouds.yaml profile.
    type: dict
    required: true
  user:
    description: Username for authenticating with the vSphere server (vCenter or ESXi).
    type: str
    required: true
  password:
    description: Password for authenticating with the vSphere server.
    type: str
    required: true
  server:
    description: Hostname or IP address of the vSphere server (vCenter or ESXi).
    type: str
    required: true
  vmname:
    description: The name of the source VMware virtual machine to be migrated.
    type: str
    required: true
  osmdatadir:
    description: Path to the os-migrate data directory, used for storing migration-related data, logs, or state.
    type: str
    required: true
  firstboot:
    description:
      - Path to a script file that will be configured to run on the first boot of the migrated virtual machine in OpenStack.
      - This is typically used for guest OS customization (e.g., network configuration via cloud-init).
    type: str
    required: false
  vddkpath:
    description: Path to the VMware VDDK (Virtual Disk Development Kit) installation directory.
    type: str
    required: true # Assuming VDDK is the primary mechanism if NBD params are not exposed here
  usesocks:
    description: If C(true), a SOCKS proxy (typically configured via environment variables) will be used for relevant network connections.
    type: bool
    required: false
    default: false
  cbtsync:
    description: If C(true), attempts to use VMware's Changed Block Tracking (CBT) for the synchronization/migration process.
    type: bool
    required: false
    default: false
  cutover:
    description:
      - Optional. If C(true), the module will perform a cutover operation, which typically means it will finalize the migration
        and switch the VM to the new OpenStack instance.
      - This might involve stopping the source VM or ensuring that no further changes are made to it during the migration.
    type: bool
    required: false
    default: false
  instanceuuid:
    description:
      - UUID of an OpenStack instance. This can be the UUID of an existing placeholder instance to which the migrated disks/VM should
        be associated, or it might be used as a reference for the newly created OpenStack VM.
    type: str
    required: true # Based on its presence in the focused example
  convhostname:
    description:
      - Optional. Hostname or IP address of a specific conversion host.
      - This might be used if the migration process involves a helper VM or a specific host for conversion tasks orchestrated by the module.
    type: str
    required: false
  compression: # Added from your Go struct list
    description:
      - Specifies the compression method to be used during data transfer (e.g., C(skipz), C(fastlz), C(zlib)), if supported.
    type: str
    required: false
  debug_mode: # Added from your Go struct list, common helpful param
    description: If C(true), enables verbose debug logging for the module.
    type: bool
    default: false
    required: false
  vsphere_insecure: # Common optional parameter for vSphere connections
    description: If C(true), SSL certificate verification for the vSphere C(server) will be skipped.
    type: bool
    default: false
    required: false
  wait: # Common operational parameter for long tasks
    description: If C(true), the module will wait for the migration operation to complete before returning.
    type: bool
    default: true
    required: false
  timeout: # Common operational parameter for long tasks
    description: Overall timeout in seconds for the migration operation.
    type: int
    default: 3600 # 1 hour, as an example
    required: false
requirements:
  - openstacksdk # For OpenStack interaction with dst_cloud
  - VMware VDDK (specified by C(vddkpath))
  - Python libraries for vSphere interaction (e.g., pyvmomi) may be needed by underlying logic.
